# Lab Test  â€“ Driving Behavior & Neural Networks

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This lab test uses the **Driving Behavior Dataset** to explore the application of **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**. The goal is to understand how input data is processed through a network using the **forward pass**, how errors are measured with a **loss function**, and how the **backpropagation algorithm** updates weights to improve predictions.

- **File name**: `Driving Behavior Dataset.csv`
- **Columns**: `Acceleration`, `Speed`, `Steering`, `Class`
- **Target**: `Class` (Driving behavior category)

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts

### 1. Neuron Forward Pass
Formula:
```math
y = f(Î£(wáµ¢ â‹… xáµ¢) + b)
```
Where:
- `xáµ¢` â†’ input features (e.g., speed, acceleration)
- `wáµ¢` â†’ weights (importance of each feature)
- `b` â†’ bias (adjustment term)
- `f()` â†’ activation function (Sigmoid, ReLU, etc.)
- `y` â†’ neuron output

ðŸ‘‰ This step is called the **Forward Pass**.

---

### 2. Loss Function
The **loss function** measures the difference between predicted output and actual target.

Common loss:
```math
L = (y_true - y_pred)Â²   # Mean Squared Error
```
ðŸ‘‰ This step happens **after forward pass**, to compute error.

### 3. Backpropagation Algorithm
Backpropagation is used to **train the neural network** by updating weights.
Steps:
1. Perform **forward pass** to calculate prediction.
2. Compute **loss function**.
3. Apply **chain rule** to compute gradients (derivatives).
4. Update weights using:
```math
w = w - Î· * (âˆ‚L/âˆ‚w)
```
Where `Î·` is the learning rate.

ðŸ‘‰ This step is called the **Backward Pass**.

- **Forward Pass** â†’ Compute neuron output.
- **Loss Function** â†’ Calculate error.
- **Backward Pass (Backpropagation)** â†’ Update weights to reduce error.

This cycle repeats until the network achieves good accuracy.
